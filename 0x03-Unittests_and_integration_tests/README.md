# Unittests and integration tests

## Unittests

Unittests are tests that test a single function or method. They are usually written by the developer of the code, and are executed by the developer. Unittests are used to test the functionality of the code and to ensure that it works as expected.

## Integration tests

Integration tests are tests that test multiple functions or methods together. They are usually written by the developer of the code, and are executed by the developer. Integration tests are used to test the functionality of the code and to ensure that it works as expected.

## How to run unittests

To run unittests, you can use the following command:

```python
python -m unittest discover
```

This command will run all the unittests in the current directory and its subdirectories.

## How to run integration tests

To run integration tests, you can use the following command:

```python
python -m unittest discover -s tests/integration
```

This command will run all the integration tests in the tests/integration directory and its subdirectories.

## How to write unittests

To write unittests, you can use the following template:

```python
import unittest

class TestMyClass(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_my_method(self):
        # Test code goes here
        pass
```

In this template, the TestMyClass class inherits from the unittest.TestCase class. The test_my_method method is a test method that tests the functionality of the my_method method in the MyClass class.

The pass statement is used to indicate that the test has passed. You can use other statements to indicate that the test has failed, such as self.fail() or self.assertEqual().

You can also use the unittest.main() function to run all the tests in a module. This function automatically discovers all the test classes in the module and runs them.
